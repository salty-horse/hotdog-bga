 * Hotdog game options description
 *
 * In this file, you can define your game options (= game variants).
 *
 * Note: If your game has no variant, you don't have to modify this file.
 *
 * Note²: All options defined in this file should have a corresponding "game state labels"
 *        with the same ID (see "initGameStateLabels" in hotdog.game.php)
 *
 * !! It is not a good idea to modify this file when a game is running !!
